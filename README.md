# A/BTesting
Hi, I'm Hoon. I'm also interested in a variety of A/B test using statistical methods.An A/B test is a randomized experiment used to compare two versions (A and B) of a product, feature, or design to determine which performs better. It splits users into two groups, exposing each to one version, and measures a specific metric (e.g., conversion rate or click-through rate) to evaluate performance. The goal is to make data-driven decisions by testing changes in a controlled and statistically significant way.This repository is dedicated to my practice and exploration of various A/B test.Thank you!
